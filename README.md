# Python-Project-Submission
You will create a book suggestion app that integrates various concepts you’ve learned. This project will involve data collection, data processing, user interaction, error handling, and code quality

1. Data Collection
• Web Scraping: Use web scraping techniques to gather book data from a reliable
source. Create a file to store the scraped data. Ensure the data includes book titles,
authors, genres, publication years, popularity, and rankings.
OR
• API Integration: Alternatively, find a suitable API that provides book data. Integrate
this API into your project to fetch the required information.
2. Data Processing:
Pandas: Utilize the Pandas library to read and manipulate the collected data. Ensure the
data is cleaned and structured appropriately for further use.
3. User Interaction:
• Filtered Book List: Implement functionality to filter the book list based on userspecified criteria such as popularity, ranking, or year of publication. Allow the user to
choose the genre and apply filters accordingly.
• Random Book Suggestion: Create a feature that generates a random book
suggestion from the selected genre. Ensure the suggestion is truly random and
includes all relevant details about the book.
4. Error Handling:
Implement robust error handling methods to manage potential issues, such as network
errors, invalid user inputs, and data processing errors. Ensure the app provides informative
error messages and continues to run smoothly.
5. Code Quality:
Write clean, well-documented code. Add comments to explain the purpose of each function
and important code segments. Ensure the code follows best practices for readability and
maintainability.
At the end of this project, you would have created a bot with all the complex concepts you have
learnt throughout the course.
